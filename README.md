# Notes

As an applicant, this mini-project was an interesting reflection on my skills as a full-stack coder. As such, I feel the need to lay out some disclosures (excuses):
- Out of safety-in-the-crowd mentality, I chose to use the MERN starter project [http://mern.io/]. This choice slowed me down considerably, and led to a less rigorous piece of code. Specifically:
 - The way the starter pack implemented server side rendering took me a while to understand
 - the react-router was on version 3 which has a very different API from v4 which I have experience with
 - deciding which starter features to rip out took a quite bit of time, especially to fix functionality after removing the feature.
- My experience with mongoDB is from college, and my data model is probably amateurish.

As a result, I do not consider this my best work, nor representative of my production code. Given a real project, I would have structured in a more reasonable manner, incorprated unit tests on server and client side, actually used stylesheets, added common error handling, etc.
